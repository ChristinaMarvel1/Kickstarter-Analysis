# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
## Analysis of Kickstarters Based on Launch Date and Goals
In this first Challenge, for the Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp I used Excel programs to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and funding goals.
###### Deliverable 1: Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart
In this project, I made the following calculations of the data:
* Renamed Excel File and added a new Sheet called *Theater Outcomes By Launch Date*.
* Created a *Years* Column using UNIX Data Conversion tools.
* Created a Pivot Table (Labelled as *Theater Outcomes by Launch Date*)
* The Parent Category was filtered for "theaters"
* A line chart was created based on the relationship between outcomes and launch month.
* The line chart was titled and attached as *Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch*.
###### Deliverable 2: Outcomes Based on Goals Chart
In this project, I made the following calculations of the data:
* Created a New Sheet *Outcomes Based on Goals*
* Created the Columns to analyze increments of Goal Amounts.
* Utilized the *COUNTIFS()* function to calculate the Successful, Failed, and Canceled plays based on the incremental goal amounts.
* Used the *SUM* function to populate *Total Projects* and percentages of Successful, Failed, and Canceled plays based on the incremental goal amounts.
* Created a Line Chart which is uploaded as *Outcomes_vs_Goals*
###### Deliverable 3: A written analysis of the results
  When we look at the the *Outcomes Based on Launch Date* chart, we see that the most successful plays are launched in the Spring and Summer months. There seems to be a gradual decline as Autumn and Winter approach. There is a slight increase in successful plays in February which might be due to Valentine's Day celebrations. We could analyze that month further to see what kind of plays were successful for the public. Seeing which kinds of plays were successful during which months might help to determine themes of plays that would be better suited for specific release dates throughout the year.
    In analysis of the *Outcomes Based on Goals* chart, we see that generally, the higher the goal amount for the plays, the higher of percentage that the campaign will faile. Conversely, we also see that the lower the goal amount, the higher the rate of successful campaigns. There is an exception between the goal amounts between $35,000 to $45,000 so I suggest a further analysis of those plays and their release dates to see if there was another factor contributing to their success. 
    In conclusion, plays with smaller budgets are generally more successfull, especially when released during the Spring and Summer months.
